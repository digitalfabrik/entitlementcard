## What is a "entitlementcard"

Short answer, it is a whitelabel for benefit cards in Germany, mainly targeted at volunteers and socially vulnerable
groups.

To name some examples, this project has a whitelabel for

- the [digital volunteer card](#what-is-a-_ehrenamtskarte_) and
- the Nuremberg Social Pass

### What is a _Ehrenamtskarte_?

A _Ehrenamtskarte_ is a benefit card for volunteers in Bavaria, Germany.

Translated from [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrenamtskarte):

> The Ehrenamtskarte (also Ehrenamtspass) is a personal document in Germany that serves as proof of special
> voluntary commitment. Such a document can be issued, for example, by the state, federal states,
> municipalities or volunteer agencies.
>
> Depending on how it is implemented, it may be linked to documentation of the type and scope of the activity,
> the skills required for it and any qualification measures. An Ehrenamtskarte or Freiwilligenausweis can also bring
> certain benefits, such as discounts on tickets or access to museums or other public institutions, or benefits
> with cooperation partners, such as companies, institutions and other supporters.

## Features

**This project consists of the following components:**

- A mobile app for Android and iOS in the folder `frontend`. [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) was used to implement the
  app.
  The app offers the following functions:
    - Display of accepting stores from different categories with different symbols on a map.
    - Display details of an accepting store with descriptive text, address, phone number, email address and website.
    - A page to browse accepting stores with optional sorting by distance from the current location.
    - An ID function for an entitlementcard
    - A reliable way to verify another entitlementcard.
    - An application form for a new volunteer card.
- A `backend` implemented in Kotlin (JVM) that is responsible for the management of all accruing data.
    - Interfaces for the app: retrieving accepting stores, verifying digital volunteer cards and receiving applications.
    - Interface for the administration web portal: Entering new digital volunteer cards and querying applications.
- A web portal for the administration of digital volunteer cards, implemented with [React](https://reactjs.org/) in the
  folder `administration`.
- A Postgres or [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) database to store the accepting stores, as well as the digital volunteer
  cards and applications.
- [Martin](https://github.com/urbica/martin), for queries to display accepting stores on the map.

## About the project

This project was created by 6 students of
the [Software Engineering Master's programme](https://elite-se.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/) of Universität Augsburg,
TU München und LMU München.

We were supported by [Tür an Tür – Digitalfabrik gGmbH](https://tuerantuer.de/digitalfabrik/) in our cooperation
with the _Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Familie, Arbeit und Soziales_ (Bavarian State Ministry for Family, Labour
and Social Affairs).
