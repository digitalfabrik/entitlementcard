  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific 'variants', see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this 'flutter' section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # 'family' key with the font family name, and a 'fonts' key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: TexGyreHeroes
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/koblenz/fonts/texgyreheros-regular.otf
        - asset: assets/koblenz/fonts/texgyreheros-italic.otf
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/koblenz/fonts/texgyreheros-bold.otf
          weight: 700
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
